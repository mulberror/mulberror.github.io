But since most of the posts was lost, and I happened to come across ryan4yin ’s blog, I learned about the DoIt theme made by HEIGE-PCloud. The DoIt theme is very much in line with the style of blog I envisioned at the beginning, so it took me a while to rebuild my personal blog straight away, and in the meantime I also spent a little bit of time learning a little bit of front-end knowledge from scratch, and briefly wrote a humble personal homepage My Little World.

First, install Go and Hugo, and configure it according to the official documentation Hugo Document. After installing the dependencies, you can proceed with the local blog configuration. I chose the DoIt theme and directly referred to the documentation written by the author Theme Documentation - Basic Concepts. However, since the author’s documentation is applicable to DoIt version 0.2.X, I encountered a few issues while writing this article, which was also when I configured my blog.

I previously tried configuring three themes. If I simply pushed the static resources generated by hugo server in the \\public directory directly to the GitHub repository, the rendered static pages would have various issues. Therefore, I adopted the deployment method from the official documentation. According to the official configuration method, you generally only need to pay attention to replacing the branch information in .github/workflows/hugo.yaml and the Hugo version information in HUGO_VERSION with your corresponding values.

After pushing local resources to the GitHub repository, Vercel will directly sync the resources, and the deployment speed is very fast. Log in to Vercel with your GitHub account or register a Vercel account and link it to your GitHub account. Then click Add New... to import the blog deployed to Gitpage from the GitHub repository. Importing the corresponding GitHub project in Vercel Choosing the Hugo framework After importing, the project in Vercel is connected to the selected GitHub repository. As long as you commit once locally, the project in Vercel will be redeployed. And each hosted project is given a separate url to connect to, so that it is easy to resolve your own domain name.
